## General Approach
Wireframes helped me get an initial Approach.
I started with the Front end because I am a visual learner it helped to see things begin to come to life.
I built a skeleton and did not implement the styling. I had a generic look.

I started the backend microservices one step at a time. From Eureka, Zuul-gateway, to my project api.
I built my package and was ready to move on to front end and connect the backend to the frontend.
