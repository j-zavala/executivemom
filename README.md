## Technologies Used

### Back-end
1. PostgreSQL
2. Docker
3. Spring Boot

### Front-end
1. Bootstrap
2. Axios
3. Formik
4. Moment
5. React
6. Amazon Web Services

## General Approach
Wireframes helped me get an initial Approach.
I started with the Front end because I am a visual learner it helped to see things begin to come to life.
I built a skeleton with components and did not implement any styling at great lengths. I had a generic look.

I started the backend microservices one step at a time. From Eureka, Zuul-gateway, to my project api.
I built my package and was ready to move on to front end and connect the backend to the frontend.

I used axios for my api calls and was successfully calling from my backend.
Once I saw my calls coming in I felt confident styling.
I used several cool websites for color like colorbox.io which gives you a shades of any given color.
I also was conceptualizing ideas along the way and rebranded my concept.

I was then in a good place to deploy to AWS.

## Unsolved Problems
1. Signup - I need to implement on the front end.
2. Good Vibes Button - I would like to go through an iterable list of positive messages for future state.
3. Styling - I would also like to spend some time styling. I used bootstrap which restricted styling.
4. Logo - Redesign logo during downtime.
